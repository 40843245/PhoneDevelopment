# Calculate elapse time from running a project
## Objectives
As the title says, in this article, I will teach you, in Android Studio, how to calculate the elapse time from start of a project to now. 

Then update it.

## Prequisite 
1. Basic concept of elapse time.
2. Basic concept of an event handler.
## Review
If you dont know about the prequisites, dont worry. It is simpler than understanding concept of OOP. 

Additionally, I will use the as simple as I can way to introduce them.

Let's get started.

1. elapse time : 
 
Elapse time from start of a project to now refers the difference between now and start of a project.

It can simply be represented as the formula.

 elapse time from start of a project to now = now - start of a project.

2. event callback function : 

Consider the following scenario.

Once specified conditions are both met (or 1 condition is met), then immediately invoke the event handler.

### NOTICE 
Notice that there are difference between event handlers and event callback functions.

However, event handlers are 1 kind of event callback functions.
