# setText -- Set the text 
To set the text, you can either 

    1. XML (Create a xml tag)
    
    ,or
    
    2. XML + Java ( Create a xml tag + change it in Java)



## method 1

Create a xml tag in activity_main.xml which defaults to be located in 

    .../res/layout/activity_main.xml

(Suppose that the layout of the project refers this file.)

For more fully about these details, see the following figure.

In the following figure, the red pen highlights the directory of activity_main.xml

 ## method 2

  Create a xml tag in activity_main.xml (as we discussed above) then change it with Java 
   
  through modifying the exisiting tag in the file named MainActivity.java which defaults to be located in 
   
      .../<your-application-name>/MainActivity.java
  
  where 
     
  <your-application-name> is the name of your application in the project.
 

  Again, for more fully about these details, see the following figure.

## NOTE
   
It is critical to pay lots of attention to these notes.
    
You always have to check lots of things once, before building the project. 
    
I just list things about this article.
    
    <h5> 1. Check the xml file for layout. </h5>
    
   The .xml is
