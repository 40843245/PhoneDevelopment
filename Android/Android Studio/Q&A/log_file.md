# find log file in Android Studio.
## Q1: See records in Android Studio.
1. In Android Studio, click Help->Show Log in Explorer. Then it will pop up a(n) file explorer.
2. In the file explorer, open the file -- idea.log

The reason why one must open the file -- idea.log for looking at info about emulator device.

Since it is stored in idea.log by default.
